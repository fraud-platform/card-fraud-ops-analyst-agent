# Temporary Reports

This folder is for short-lived report snapshots shared for review in GitHub.

- `2026-02-25-e2e-scenarios-report.html`: full detailed stage-by-stage E2E report.
  - Generated by: `scripts/run_e2e_matrix_detailed.py`
  - Note: GitHub may not render very large HTML files inline. Download and open locally if needed.
- `e2e-scenarios-report-31matrix-20260226-081447.html`: latest 31-scenario matrix report from fresh TM+Ops runtime validation.
  - Generated by: `scripts/run_e2e_matrix_detailed.py`
  - Status: **legacy/pre-gate report**. This snapshot may show false-green pass counts because it predates strict KPI gating in the matrix runner.
  - Action: Do not use this file as release evidence. Regenerate with current scripts and verify KPI gate pass.
  - Note: GitHub may not render very large HTML files inline. Download and open locally if needed.

Delete these files in a follow-up cleanup commit after team review.
