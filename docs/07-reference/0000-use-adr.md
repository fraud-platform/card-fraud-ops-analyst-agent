# ADR 0000: Use ADR for Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Cross-repo fraud platform changes require persistent, auditable decision records.

## Decision

Use numbered ADRs in `docs/07-reference` for all non-trivial architecture and policy decisions.

## Consequences

- Decisions are traceable and reviewable.
- New major changes require new ADR entries.
